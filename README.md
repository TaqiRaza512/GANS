Project Title: MNIST GAN
Description
This repository contains the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to generate handwritten digits, mimicking the famous MNIST dataset. GANs are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks contesting with each other in a zero-sum game framework.

Project Objective
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of GANs to generate new images that resemble handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This includes training a discriminator and a generator network to respectively identify real MNIST images from fake, and to create convincing fake images that can fool the discriminator.
